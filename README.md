# Duplicate File Finder and Cleaner

## Description
Duplicate File Finder and Cleaner is a command-line based project developed using **Bash scripting**.  
It is designed to find **duplicate files**, **empty files**, and **empty folders** in a given directory.  
The program checks file content using **MD5 hash**, so files with the same data are detected even if their names are different.

This project works on **Linux and macOS** systems.
